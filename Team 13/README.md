# ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy)
A rare genetic mutation that affects males and females differently. In childhood, boys are primarily affected. Girls are not typically affected, though they may develop symptoms as adults.
Mutations in the ABCD1 gene that prevent the body from breaking down very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). 
As a result, VLCFAs build up in the brain, nervous system, and adrenal glands.
There are four types of ALD:
Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (also known as cerebral ALD, CALD, or CCALD).
Adrenal insufficiency, also called Addison’s disease.
Adrenomyeloneuropathy, a form of ALD that affects the spinal cord and nerves, typically in adult men.
Asymptomatic ALD, which occurs in people who have a mutation in the ABCD1 gene but no symptoms.
ALD prevents the body from breaking down very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), causing these fatty acid chains to build up in the brain, nervous system and adrenal gland. The accumulation is thought to cause inflammation in the body, damaging the myelin sheath.
ALD is linked to mutations in ABCD1 (ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1). This dataset displays a survey across diverse normal tissues where this gene is expressed. 

Myelination: 

Hurdles to combat:
(i) low levels of factors that promote oligodendrogenesis; (ii) cell death among newly generated oligodendrocytes, (iii) inhibitory factors in the post-injury milieu that impede remyelination, and (iv) deficient expression of key growth factors essential for proper re-construction of a highly organized myelin sheath


Damage to the myelin sheath, a hallmark feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), leads to increased levels of fatty molecules called VLCFAs, which are converted by brain cells into an inflammation-driving signaling molecule called S1P

Lorenzo’s oil inhibits ELOVL1, which further emphasizes ELOVL1’s crucial role in decreasing VLCFA levels and possibly preventing ALD phenotypes.


 In one study, ELOVL1 knockdown in fibroblasts obtained from X-ALD affected patients showed diminished C22:0-to-C26:0 elongation with dramatically reduced C26:0 levels.
