# Rare Connect
## Introduction
During the Rare Disease Hackathon, our team was profoundly moved by the personal
stories shared by speakers from the rare disease community. We recognized that while rare diseases pose
significant scientific challenges, they are fundamentally human issues, deeply affecting patients along
with their families and friends. The resilience of individuals and their guardians, often in the face of
medical professional’s skepticism, inspired us. With this human centric approach at our core, we propose
the development of Rare Connect: a platform designed to bridge the gap between individuals affected by
rare conditions, medical professionals, and research institutions through a human-centric, technology
driven approach.
## Sign-Up
The patients (or potential patients) and doctors are first prompted to sign up for the platform as
a new user. Sign-up would be manually reviewed in order to verify real users. Those with a previous
diagnosis can submit their medical records for review by both a doctor and AI to verify the accuracy of
their diagnosis, potentially identifying misdiagnoses and directing them to appropriate specialists.
Undiagnosed patients can list their symptoms for AI-assisted analysis by medical professionals,
streamlining the path to accurate diagnosis. By pairing an AI system with the medical professional, the AI
system will simultaneously be trained whilst assisting the medical professional. One important thing to
stress is that medical information of the patient will not be shared to the public and remain private with
limited access due to HIPAA.
## Community
After this process, the patient will have the option to share their stories, either publicly with
the rare disease community or privately. By making it viewable publicly, it would be shown to doctors,
website visitors, and other patients. This will foster a supportive environment where individuals can
connect with others facing similar challenges.
Insurance and Costs: Recognizing the financial burden of specialized care, Rare Connect aims to
facilitate billing through patients’ insurance, emphasizing the need for HIPAA compliance to maintain
trust and integrity amongst insurance companies and our users.
## Privacy and Security
Patient information remains confidential, in strict compliance with HIPAA. We’ll
implement an Advanced Encryption System (AES) for data security, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for account security, and conduct regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to healthcare
privacy standards.
## Use of AI
Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our AI will analyze symptom lists
submitted by patients. This method of using CNNs enables our AI to parse and understand complex
symptom descriptions effectively. By training the network on a detailed compilation of rare disease
symptoms and their textual representations, we equip the AI, using a database with supervised machine
learning, to accurately compare symptoms submitted by our user, the patient. This approach ensures a
meticulous assessment of symptom lists, identifying potential matches for known rare diseases. The result
is then sent to the medical professional for a potential evaluation that allows the medical professional to
save time and carefully evaluate the diagnosis. This not only accelerates the path to a proper diagnosis but
also significantly enhances user engagement by allowing them to communicate with a human, a medical
professional.

## Healthcare Integration
We recognize the importance of being able to integrate our service with the rest
of the healthcare ecosystem. This will allow for a more seamless process for users and we’ll be able to
have patient medical history ready to be accessed by authorized individuals.
We could also collaborate with research institutions and rare disease organizations to enrich our platform
and it would be a great addition to our databases and AI capabilities, creating a comprehensive resource
for both patients and medical professionals.
## Constant Improvement
To stay at the forefront of healthcare technology and patient care, the platform
will ask for feedback from users, including patients, doctors, and researchers. This will enable continuous
tweaks to features and usability based on real world experiences and needs our users have. The AI system
will also be capable of adaptive learning, evolving in response to new data, research findings, and
professional feedback, to ensure that the platform remains as a significant resource for the rare disease
community.
Conclusion: In conclusion, by expanding upon Rare Connect's initial proposal with a detailed focus on
HIPAA compliance, the use of AI, user engagement, and healthcare ecosystem integration, the platform is
set to revolutionize the way rare diseases are diagnosed and managed. It represents a significant step
forward in personalized healthcare, providing targeted support and resources to those affected by rare
diseases, and fostering a collaborative environment for medical professionals, researchers, and more
importantly the victims as they'll have a platform to find those similar to themselves.
