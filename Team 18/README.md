# FTIR and INAD

Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by various symptoms such as decreased muscle tone, abnormal movements, stiffness affecting all limbs, vision impairments, lack of coordination, cognitive challenges, and dementia, all of which typically manifest before the age of three.
Before the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, the diagnosis of INAD relied heavily on clinical observations, electrophysiological assessments, and imaging studies. Skin biopsies, revealing distinctive axonal enlargements and spheroid bodies within nerve endings in either the central or peripheral nervous system, served as key diagnostic criteria. Often, multiple biopsies were necessary for confirmation, leading to prolonged diagnostic journeys for affected families.
However, with the decreasing costs associated with gene and genome sequencing, along with the availability of targeted gene panel testing offered by specialized diagnostic laboratories for undiagnosed neurological conditions, and the growing awareness among physicians regarding genetic testing options, families are now receiving diagnoses much more swiftly. In some cases, diagnosis occurs within a year of the onset of initial symptoms, significantly reducing the waiting period for affected families.
The diagnosis of INAD is a time-consuming and costly process. An alternative, more effective method should be found.


Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that displays absorption bands of molecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (RNA, DNA) found in a biological sample in a single spectrum, allowing simultaneous monitoring of these molecules. This technique, along with chemometric analysis methods based on spectral analysis techniques and spectral changes, has been widely used for decades in the diagnosis and characterization of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. The sensitivity of FTIR spectroscopy to biochemical changes during the transition from normal to pathological states or during treatment demonstrates its great potential in identifying disease-associated new biomarkers and in monitoring the response to treatment and the progression/regression of the disease beyond cancer screening and diagnosis.
Various biological samples, including blood, pleural fluid, tissue, sputum, urine, bladder wash fluid, and bile samples, have been investigated using FTIR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. Compared to other samples, blood and tissue samples are widely used for diagnosis of various diseases. Among biological samples, body fluids are the most suitable for diagnosis and screening due to their rapid, easy accessibility, low cost, and non-invasiveness.
Studies on many diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and many types of cancer have yielded promising results. However, there have been no studies conducted on INAD.
The FTIR spectroscopy method can be started to be used as a new diagnostic method for INAD by working with blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This way, an early and easily accessible diagnostic method can be found.
